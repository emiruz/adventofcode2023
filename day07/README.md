# Advent of Code 2023, Day 7 Solution

[Question.](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7)

Just a DCG and some pattern matching for identifying 
hands. In part 2 the "J" value is replaced with "0" 
in order to re-use as much as possible from part 1.

Both parts of the solution are in *solution.prolog*.
You can use it as follows:
```
?- solve("input.txt",Part1,Part2).
```
where "input.txt" is the path to your AoC2023 input
file.
