# Advent of Code 2023, Day 9 Solution

[Question.](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9)

Just a DCG and some simple recursion.

Both parts of the solution are in *solution.prolog*.
You can use it as follows:
```
?- solve("input.txt",Part1,Part2).
```
where "input.txt" is the path to your AoC2023 input
file.
