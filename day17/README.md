# Advent of Code 2023, Day 17 Solution

[Question.](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/17)

This was very fiddly to get right because of the
movement restrictions and what they imply on the
path finding algorithm. Except for that its just
Dijkstra's algorithm.

I'll refactor to something more elegant soon.

```
?- solve("input.txt",Part1,Part2).
```
where "input.txt" is the path to your AoC2023 input
file.
